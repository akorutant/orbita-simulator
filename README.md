# The Orbita Simulator

![The Orbita Logo](logo.png)

The simulation program for probe space station from orbital missions to landing
including several models (ballistics, landing, radio, surface activity, etc.).
The Python language is used for satellite flight programs. Hierarchical State
Macnines Diagrams can be automatically translated into the program code also.

There are two models available in the current version of the simulator:

* **planets** - the first version of the engineering simulation dedicated to landing on planets and surface missions
* **earth** - the second version of the engineering simulation dedicated to missions on the Earth orbit.

Each model is supplemented by gravity calculators (**planets_gravity** and **earth_gravity** respectively).

The code is distributed under the GNU Public License (version 3), the documentation -- under

The simulator interface and the user manual are available in English and Russian.
